1. inside of our dev file we have a host that is listed wihtin our database group, we want to add mysql to this host through ansible using a playbook
2. in our main ansible directory "/etc/ansible" create a new playbook called database.yml
//the syntax below is verry important and "---" is not a mistake
---
- hosts: database                     //------------> any host wihtin our db group will have mysql downloaded
  become: true
  tasks:
     - name: install mysql-server
       yum: name=mariadb-server state=present update_cache=yes     


3. to execute play book run "ansible-playbook database.yml"
