**Here is how we would add host without creating an invetory file.**
1. vim /etc/ansible/hosts
2. After entering the file, scroll down to the bottom and add the host(s) like so 
[linux01]
192.168.0.53
[linux02]
192.168.4.77
3. ansible --list-hosts all


**Here we create an inventory file and add our hosts in here**
1. go to /etc/ansible and create a file called dev
2. Below is the hosts and host groups
[loadbalancer]
lb01

[webserver]
app01
app02

[database]
db01

[control]
control ansible_connection=local

controlM
3. make sure you are in the ansible directorty when running this command
ansible -i dev --list-hosts all
4. we do not want to run -i dev all the time so lets modify the ansible.cfg file make sure lines 10 and 11 look like this below soemtimes
this file is not yet created, if it is not yet created, create a ansible.cfg file in /etc/ansible
[defaults]
inventory = ./dev
