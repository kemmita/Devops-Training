1. We will want to fork instead of cloning when working with teams. Forking will allow you to make changes and the open a pull request for
when you feel a change is ready to be implmemented. Cloning is done when you widh to make a copy of the  website, but do not plan on
opening a pull request.
2. To fork on github, simple go to the repos main page and look for the fork keyword or sign. After you have forked the repo, you will want
to clone it, so you can make changes locally.
3. You will typically need to cd into the file you cloned into your local machine, run ls to see what you need to cd into.
