1. we do not want to run -i dev all the time so lets modify the ansible.cfg file make sure lines 10 and 11 look like this below soemtimes
this file is not yet created, if it is not yet created, create a ansible.cfg file in /etc/ansible. We have to do this becuase we are creating
our own inventory file. We will now be able to run "ansible --list-hosts all" instead of "anisble -i dev --list-hosts all"
[defaults]
inventory = ./dev

2. staying in the same file, go to line 62 and make sure that this line is uncommented
host_key_checking = False


3. now create a dev file in /etc/ansible "vim dev" the hosts below will need to be running at the time.
if you look at line 26, that is needed to ensure ansible that we are using ssh and that all of the hosts share the same user and password.
[webserver]
192.168.0.15
192.168.0.41


[database]
192.168.0.12


[control]
control ansible_connection=local


[all:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh
ansible_ssh_user=root
ansible_ssh_pass=welcome

4. now run "ansible --list-hosts all" and then run "ansible -m ping all" you should have no errors
