1. make sure we are in the main Ansible directory "/etc/ansible" 
2. make a new directory called playbooks, and then cd into playbooks
3. create a new yml file, this will be our playbook, let us name it hostname.yml
4. go into the file and edit the file as below, the syntax is verry important and is specific to the yml language
---
        - hosts: all
          tasks:
           - command: hostname

5. go back to our main Ansible direcotry "/etc/ansible" and run command "ansible-playbook playbooks/hostname.yml"
